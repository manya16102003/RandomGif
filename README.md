Project: Random and Searchable GIF Generator Using GIPHY API
Description:
This project involves creating a simple web application that interacts with the GIPHY API to generate GIFs. The user will first need to create an account on GIPHY Developers and generate an API key. The application will feature two main functionalities:

Random GIF Generator: Fetch and display a random GIF from GIPHY.
Searchable GIF Generator: Allow users to input text and get a GIF related to the entered text.
The project is designed to provide a basic understanding of how to use customized hooks in a React application for managing API calls and state.

Key Learning Outcomes:

Setting up an account and generating an API key on the GIPHY Developers portal.
Making API requests to fetch random and searchable GIFs.
Using React hooks to manage state and side effects.
Creating and using customized hooks for cleaner and more reusable code.

This project is an excellent starting point for anyone looking to gain hands-on experience with API integration and the use of customized hooks in React.
